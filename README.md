# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
Overview

The Handwritten-Digit-Classification System harnesses the power of machine learning to accurately classify handwritten digits. Built on the TensorFlow and Keras libraries, this project utilizes the MNIST dataset, comprising 70,000 grayscale images of digits 0 through 9. The core of the system is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, designed to be both efficient and effective, ensuring high accuracy in digit recognition tasks. This system is ideal for anyone looking to delve into machine learning applications or for practical use in digit recognition across various sectors.

Key Features

High Accuracy: Utilizes an ANN model to achieve impressive accuracy in classifying handwritten digits.
Efficient Processing: Optimized for quick processing, suitable for real-time applications.
Scalable and Adaptable: Designed for easy adaptation and scalability to handle more complex classification tasks.
Installation

Navigate to the project directory.
Run the script with Python:
Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset, which is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale representation of handwritten digits.

Model Architecture
The model features:

An input layer that flattens the 28x28 images into a 784-dimensional vector.
A dense hidden layer with 128 neurons using ReLU activation.
A softmax output layer with 10 neurons, each representing a class of digit from 0 to 9.
Training and Evaluation
The model is trained over 5 epochs, showing improvement in accuracy with each epoch. After training, it's evaluated on the test set, typically achieving around 97-98% accuracy.
